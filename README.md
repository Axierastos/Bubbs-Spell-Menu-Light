# Overview:
I'm sure some have felt like the normal version of this mod goes over the top. The menu is big, it's bulky, and it is somewhat intrusive to the world screen. In consideration to this feeling I've made a "light" version of this mod, which only includes a search bar. This version is much more integrated with the vanilla GUI, as the search results are displayed in the hotbar itself; nice and tucked away on the bottom of the screen.
